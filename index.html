                <p>Racism is a harmful belief that one race is superior to others, leading to discrimination, inequality, and injustice. It affects individuals and communities in profound ways, creating divisions and perpetuating stereotypes. Ending racism requires collective effort through education, empathy, and strong legal frameworks that ensure equality for all. By working together to understand and embrace our differences, we can build a more inclusive and just society for everyone.</p>
